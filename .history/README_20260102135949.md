# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a production-ready machine learning pipeline
to predict telecom customer churn. The goal is to design an end-to-end ML workflow
that follows industry best practices, from data preprocessing to model training
and deployment readiness.

## Project Structure

- `data/` – dataset storage (excluded from GitHub)
- `notebooks/` – exploratory analysis and inspection
- `src/` – production-grade Python modules
- `tests/` – unit tests (in progress)

## Current Progress

Note: Initial exploratory analysis and data cleaning were performed prior to production refactoring to validate data quality, remove inconsistencies, and prevent leakage. This repository focuses on the production-ready ML lifecycle, including preprocessing standardization, baseline modeling, evaluation, and deployment preparation.

- Modular project structure established
- Data cleaning and preprocessing refactored from notebooks to Python modules
- Pipeline-based preprocessing designed to prevent data leakage
- Baseline modeling implemented - The baseline model achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.77, indicating good discriminatory power. It prioritizes recall for churners (82%), successfully identifying most customers at risk of churn, at the expense of precision (37%). This behavior is acceptable at the baseline stage, as missing churners is typically more costly than false positives in telecom retention strategies.

## Tech Stack
