# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a production-ready machine learning pipeline
to predict telecom customer churn. The goal is to design an end-to-end ML workflow
that follows industry best practices, from data preprocessing to model training
and deployment readiness.

## Project Structure

- `data/` – dataset storage (excluded from GitHub)
- `notebooks/` – exploratory analysis and inspection
- `src/` – production-grade Python modules
- `tests/` – unit tests (in progress)

## Current Progress

Note: Initial exploratory analysis and data cleaning were performed prior to production refactoring to validate data quality, remove inconsistencies, and prevent leakage. This repository focuses on the production-ready ML lifecycle, including preprocessing standardization, baseline modeling, evaluation, and deployment preparation.

- Modular project structure established

- Data cleaning and preprocessing refactored from notebooks to Python modules

- Pipeline-based preprocessing designed to prevent data leakage

- Baseline modeling implemented - The baseline model achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.77, indicating good discriminatory power. It prioritizes recall for churners (82%), successfully identifying most customers at risk of churn, at the expense of precision (37%). This behavior is acceptable at the baseline stage, as missing churners is typically more costly than false positives in telecom retention strategies.

- The baseline modeling was reimplemented again, after the correction of a wrongly applied scaling on the encoded categorical features. The new results show AUC-ROC of 0.77 which is the same as before, with a recall of 10% and precision of 79% for churners. This indicates the model was not able to identify most customer at risk of churn, which is not ideal. Further feature engineering and model tuning are needed to improve recall.

- Error analysis conducted to identify misclassification patterns and what was discovered was that among the false negatives (churners predicted as non-churners), a significant portion had high tenure months, low monthly charges and high total charges, indicating that long-term customers with lower bills and higher total charges were being overlooked by the model. Conversely, false positives (non-churners predicted as churners) often exhibited moderate tenure but higher monthly charges, suggesting that customers with mid-level engagement but higher costs were being misclassified.

- Error analysis was conducted again after removing the scaling before the modeling. The new findings indicate that false negatives (churners predicted as non-churners) tend to have long tenure months, lower monthly charges and higher total charges, suggesting that loyal customers with lower bills are being overlooked by the model. On the other hand, false positives (non-churners predicted as churners) often have short/middle tenure months, higher monthly charges, and lower total charges, indicating that customers with higher bills are being misclassified.

- Two hypothesis was formed based on the error analysis:

  1. Customers with high tenure months, low monthly charges and high total charges are less likely to churn, so the model may be misclassifying them due to their strong loyalty despite lower bills.
  2. Customers with moderate tenure but higher monthly charges may be more sensitive to price increases or service issues, leading to misclassification as churners.

- Binary and interaction feature engineering targeting long-tenure low-charge customers did not materially affect recall, suggesting the churn signal in this segment is weakly linear. This motivated exploration of class weighting, threshold optimization, and non-linear models.
