# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a production-ready machine learning pipeline
to predict customer churn. The goal is to design an end-to-end ML workflow
that follows industry best practices, from data preprocessing to model training
and deployment readiness.

## Project Structure

- `data/` – dataset storage (excluded from GitHub)
- `notebooks/` – exploratory analysis and inspection
- `src/` – production-grade Python modules
- `tests/` – unit tests (in progress)

## Current Progress

- Data cleaning and preprocessing refactored from notebooks to Python modules
- Modular project structure established
- Pipeline-based preprocessing designed to prevent data leakage

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas / NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Git & GitHub

## Next Steps

- Build full preprocessing + model pipeline
- Model evaluation and validation
- Model persistence
- Inference script
- Deployment (later stage)
